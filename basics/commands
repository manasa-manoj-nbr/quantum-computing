For Windows, call commands one by one:

conda create --name cwq
conda activate cwq

conda install python=3.12
conda install pip

pip install qiskit
pip install -U qiskit-aer

pip install matplotlib
pip install qiskit_ibm_runtime
pip install pylatexenc

It is important to specify Python version 12 because, as of today (2024-11-26), the automatically installed version 13 causes an error during the installation of qiskit_aer.
